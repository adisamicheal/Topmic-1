          Recognizing individual dierences and establishing 
          clear learning pathways for all children is the key 
          to optimizing educational opportunities and outcomes. 
          Differentiation in the classroom promotes critical 
          and creative thinking processing skills, while programs 
          in spelling, reading, grammar and mathematics 
          curriculum are well sequenced to ensure active student 
          transition between year groups. Learning support is 
          oe red in the form of Extension or Remediation to 
          those students who require additional intervention.
