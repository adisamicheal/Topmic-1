							<p>Educators respond to children's ideas, 
						and in turn link these ideas to extend each student's knowledge
						in multiple areas of learning. Projects provide opportunities 
						for students to work in collaboration; exploring ideas and testing hypotheses. Online and project based learning opportunities encourage our students to focus, 
						participate and fully engage in their learning.</p>
