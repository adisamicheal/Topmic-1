						<h2>Primary school is such an important time for children, 
						both socially and academically, 
						as the foundation is laid for lifelong learning.</h2>
						<p>Differentiation in the classroom promotes critical and 
						creative thinking processing skills, while programs in spelling, 
						reading, grammar and mathematics curriculum are well sequenced 
						to ensure effective student transition between year groups. 
						Learning support is offered in the form of Extension or 
						Remediation to those students who require additional intervention.</p>
						<h2>Reggio Emilia</h2>
						<p>Educators respond to children's ideas, 
						and in turn link these ideas to extend each student's knowledge
						in multiple areas of learning. Projects provide opportunities 
						for students to work in collaboration; exploring ideas and testing hypotheses. Online and project based learning opportunities encourage our students to focus, 
						participate and fully engage in their learning.</p>

						<h2>Your Child as an Individual</h2>
						<p>Recognising individual differences and establishing
