              At Winsome we believe in providing a dual approach to education which supports every child to become confident learners. For us, the quality of relationship developed with the child has a direct link to the effective practice of teaching the children and guiding them to discover new things and think for themselves. We believe that if the teacher-child relationship is based on mutual respect, active listening and the sharing of knowledge and skills, the child’s capacity to learn and discover the world is enhanced.
